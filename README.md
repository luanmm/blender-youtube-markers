# Blender add-on: YouTube Markers

This Blender add-on makes it easy to export your markers to a formatted list, to be used in YouTube descriptions as video chapters.

## Installation

To install this add-on, these are the steps:

1. Download the latest release
2. Go to "Edit -> Preferences..."
3. Select "Add-ons" section
4. Press the "Install..." button
5. Select the downloaded package
6. Enable the "Import-Export: YouTube Markers" add-on

## How to use

Just insert the markers as identifiers for the video chapters (as you may be doing already to label the video content). Then, go to "File -> Export -> YouTube chapters list (.txt)" and select a destination file. The content of this file will be formatted as required, so it can be copied directly to your video description in YouTube.

Note: The chapters list in YouTube requires an initial marker (at the first frame) to work. This add-on doesn't insert or change anything automatically, so you must remember to add it.
